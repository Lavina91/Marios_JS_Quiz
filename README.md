### Mario's JS Code Quiz

In this fun little quiz, we are going to test the user on their knowledge of Javascript. At first, the user is presented with a introduction page welcoming the user and giving a brief explanation of the quiz. Once the user presses the start button, the user is presented with the first question and the timer begins. If the user answers correctly, the user is presented with the next question and 10 points is added to their score. If the user answers incorrectly, 15 secs are taken off the timer. The quiz ends once the user answers all the questions, in which the remaining time left is added to the user's score or if the timer reaches 0. After the quiz is over, the user is prompted to save their initials and score to the high score board.
